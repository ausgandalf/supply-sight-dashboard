# Supply Sight Dashboard - Development Notes

## Project Overview
A React-based supply chain dashboard that provides real-time inventory management, demand forecasting, and warehouse operations visualization. Built with modern web technologies and a GraphQL backend.

## Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Framework
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type safety and modern React features
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first styling and rapid UI development

**Rationale**: React 19 offers improved performance and concurrent features, while TypeScript provides compile-time error checking. Vite's dev server is significantly faster than Create React App, and Tailwind CSS enables rapid prototyping without context switching.

### State Management
- **Custom hooks** (`useInventory`) instead of external state management libraries
- **Local state** with `useState` for component-specific data
- **Derived state** with `useMemo` for computed values

**Rationale**: For this application scope, custom hooks provide sufficient state management without the complexity of Redux or Zustand. The state is relatively simple and doesn't require complex state machines.

### Data Fetching
- **GraphQL** with Apollo Server for flexible data queries
- **Custom API service** layer for GraphQL operations
- **Error boundaries** and loading states for better UX

**Rationale**: GraphQL provides efficient data fetching with precise control over what data is retrieved. The custom service layer abstracts GraphQL complexity from components.

### UI Components
- **Atomic design** approach with reusable components
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

**Rationale**: Component reusability reduces development time and ensures consistency. Lucide provides a cohesive icon set, while Recharts offers powerful charting capabilities.

### Backend Framework
- **Node.js** with **Apollo Server** for GraphQL API
- **Standalone server** architecture for simplicity
- **Mock data** with realistic supply chain scenarios
- **GraphQL schema-first** approach for type safety

**Rationale**: Node.js provides fast development and deployment, Apollo Server offers excellent GraphQL tooling, and the standalone architecture simplifies the development workflow. Mock data enables frontend development without backend dependencies.

## Trade-offs Made

### Performance vs. Development Speed
- **Simple state updates** without optimistic updates or rollback mechanisms

**Trade-off**: Chose rapid development and simplicity over performance optimization for handling large datasets.

### Data Consistency vs. Real-time Updates
- **Polling-based updates** instead of WebSocket subscriptions
- **Local state updates** after successful API calls
- **No offline support** or data synchronization

**Trade-off**: Chose simplicity and reliability over real-time updates and offline capabilities.

### Type Safety vs. Flexibility
- **Strict TypeScript** with explicit interfaces
- **Limited generic types** for API responses
- **Fixed enum values** for product status

**Trade-off**: Prioritized type safety and developer experience over runtime flexibility.

### UI Complexity vs. Accessibility
- **Basic accessibility** features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- **No advanced features** like screen reader optimization or high contrast themes
- **Simple color schemes** without extensive theming

**Trade-off**: Balanced modern UI design with basic accessibility requirements.

## What Would Improve With More Time

### 1. Production Readiness
- **Authentication & authorization** system
- **Comprehensive testing** (unit, integration, E2E)
- **CI/CD pipeline** with automated deployments
- **Monitoring, logging, and error tracking**

### 2. Advanced Features
- **Sort functionality**
- **Real-time updates** with WebSocket subscriptions
- **Export functionality** (CSV, PDF, Excel)
- **Bulk operations** and advanced filtering
- **Predictive analytics** for demand forecasting

### 3. Performance & Scalability
- **Virtual scrolling** for large datasets
- **Database optimization** and caching strategies
- **Microservices architecture** for backend
- **Load balancing** and horizontal scaling
